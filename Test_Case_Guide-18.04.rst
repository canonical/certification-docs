Introduction
============

This guide describes the jobs performed in Ubuntu server certification
testing. A job can be anything executed by Checkbox, typically these are either
information gathering jobs or test cases.

Test cases follow the format Category/TestName such as `ethernet/detect`. Some
job names may simply be a TestName without the category designator. These are
typically jobs that gather and/or attach hardware info for the submission file.

Jobs are grouped into three categories:

mandatory_include
    Items that Checkbox *will* run every time. These jobs can not be skipped.

include
    Items that Checkbox *may* run. These jobs can be skipped depending on the
    presence or absence of certain components, or software.

bootstrap_include
    Items that Checkbox will run before the final test list is created. These
    jobs accomplish tasks such as gathering initial system information that is
    used to determine which test cases are applicable to the SUT.

This guide is based on the `server-full-16.04.pxu` list used for full Server
Certification. Other lists in the `canonical-certification-server` UI are
either subsets of this list, or not applicable to 16.04 certification, such as
the 14.04 lists.

 the CPU.

cpu/scaling_test-log-attach
 Attaches the log generated by cpu/scaling_test to the results submission.

cpu/topology
 Parses information about CPU topology provided by proc and sysfs and checks
 that they are consistent.

disk/detect
 Uses lsblk to gather information about each disk detected on the system
 under test.

disk/disk_cpu_load_{name}
 Check to ensure CPU load of {product_slug} is not too high

disk/disk_stress_ng_{name}
 Disk stress_ng test for {product_slug}

disk/read_performance_{name}
 Verify that disk storage performs at or above baseline performance

disk/smart_{name}
 This tests the SMART capabilities for {product_slug} (Note that this test
 may not work against hardware RAID)

disk/stats_{name}
 This test checks disk stats, generates some activity and rechecks stats to
 verify they've changed. It also verifies that disks appear in the various
 files they're supposed to. . This test will inspect the following disk: .
 product name: {product_slug} sysfs path: {path} device node path:
 /dev/{name}

ethernet/detect
 Test to detect and return information about available network controllers
 on the system under test.

ethernet/ethertool_check_device{__index__}_{interface}
 This test executes ethtool requests against ethernet device {__index__}
 ({interface}).

ethernet/ethtool_info
 No description available

ethernet/info_automated
 Gathers some info on the current state of your network devices. If no
 devices are found, the test will exit with an error.

ethernet/multi_iperf3_nic_device{__index__}_{interface}
 This test uses iperf3 to ensure network devices pass data at an acceptable
 minimum percentage of advertized speed.

info/hdparm_{name}.txt
 Attaches the bootchart png file for bootchart runs

info/kvm_output
 Attaches the debug log from the virtualization/kvm_check_vm test to the
 results submission.

mediacard/sd-preinserted
 This is a fully automated version of mediacard/sd-automated and assumes
 that the system under test has a memory card device plugged in prior to
 checkbox execution. It is intended for SRU automated testing.

memory/info
 This test checks the amount of memory which is reporting in meminfo against
 the size of the memory modules detected by DMI.

memory/memory_stress_ng
 Test to perform some basic stress and exercise of system memory via the
 stress_ng tool. This test also includes an over-commit function to force
 swapping to disk, thus SUTs should have suitably large swap files for the
 amount of RAM they have installed.

miscellanea/bmc_info
 This will gather some info about the BMC itself for diagnostic purposes.
 This will not works on non-IPMI systems like AMT and blade/sled type
 systems.

miscellanea/fwupdate
 Determine if EFI firmware supports update from OS.

miscellanea/ipmi_test
 This will run some basic commands in-band against a BMC, verifying that
 IPMI works. Use of MAAS to deploy the system implicitly tests out-of-band
 BMC control.

miscellanea/oops
 Run Firmware Test Suite (fwts) oops tests.

miscellanea/oops_results.log
 Attaches the FWTS oops results log to the submission

miscellanea/sosreport
 Generates a baseline sosreport of logs and system data

miscellanea/sosreport_attachment
 No description available

networking/predictable_names
 Verify that all network interfaces have predictable names.

optical/detect
 Detects optical drives (CD/DVD) attached to the system.

optical/read-automated_{name}
 This is an automated version of optical/read. It assumes you have already
 inserted a data CD into your optical drive prior to running Checkbox.

power-management/rtc
 Verify that the Real-time clock (RTC) device functions properly, if
 present.

stress/cpu_stress_ng_test
 Impose a high system load using the 'stress_ng' tool to exercise the CPU
 for several hours. The test is considered passed if the system does not
 freeze and if the stress_ng tool does not report errors.

usb/detect
 Detects and shows USB devices attached to this system.

usb/storage-preinserted
 Tests USB 2.0 or 1.1 ports on a system by doing write/read/compare tests on
 randomly created data. It requires that a USB stick is plugged into an
 available USB port before running the certification suite.

usb3/storage-preinserted
 Tests USB 3.0 ports on a system by doing write/read/compare tests on
 randomly created data. It requires that a USB stick is plugged into an
 available USB port before running the certification suite. Additionally,
 it will only work with USB sticks and ports rated for USB 3.0 speeds or
 faster.

virtualization/kvm_check_vm
 Verifies that a KVM guest can be created and booted using an Ubuntu Server
 cloud image.

virtualization/verify_lxd
 Verifies that an LXD container can be created and launched
